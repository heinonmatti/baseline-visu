  Background: Let's Move It is a cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluating a novel theory-based intervention, which aimed to reduce sedentary behaviour (SB) and increase physical activity (PA) among older adolescents in vocational schools, by targeting environmental and psychosocial determinants of the phenomena. This paper describes the characteristics of the LMI baseline cohort in both arms, and explores the possibilities for visually presenting such data, making use of recent developments in software and network analyses. We provide a template for researchers to apply these tools to other data.
  Methods: At baseline, 1123 adolescents in 57 classes in 6 school units participated in the study. Data were gathered with 7-day accelerometry, bioimpedance measures and questionnaires, which were used to measure health status, activity behaviours, and potential constructs mediating the effect of the intervention on outcomes. Data were visualised e.g. combining ridge plots and diamond plots; network analysis was used to investigate relations between psychosocial variables and outcomes.
  Results: The participants were 16-49 years old (M = 18.5, SD = xx, Md = xx). On average, they engaged in moderate-to-vigorous PA xx (SD = xx, Md = xx) and SB xx minutes daily and xx breaks in SB. Several variables differ among the four educational tracks, but not across intervention and control groups. 
  Conclusion: The usage of behaviour change techniques  Autonomous motivation . Comparability to similar populations.. We have also shown benefits of presenting such data visually, and encourage researchers to routinely make the extensive analyses and descriptions they have produced, available in website supplements.

# Background

Declining physical activity (PA) and increasing sedentary behaviour (SB) are growing concerns for public health, especially for individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) (). Patterns of low PA among adults begin earlier in life. Among children, the evidence regarding psychosocial predictors of PA and SB, and especially objectively measured activity, is quite clear (CITE KATJA? ). There is however less knowledge about the predictors of PA and SB in adolescence. As there is evidence that the declines in PA and increases in SB are already evident in children and adolescence  (CITATION:Husu et al. BMC Publ Health 2016, Makelä et al. 2016 KATJA? TOMMI?  ), there is a need for further research on to how to improve PA and SB among adolescents, so that healthier behavioral patterns can be carried into adulthood. This is crucial from both the point of view of individuals' later quality of life, as well as from that of a healthcare system struggling with rising costs of treating non-communicable diseases (Dieleman et al. 2018 LancetREF :  ).
