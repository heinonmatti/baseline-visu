<p>I have reminded myself even in my spare time, what kind of positive consequences frequent PA would have in my life. I have monitored my PA by marking the PA occasions on an exercise log on paper. I have monitored my PA by using a smart phone, e.g. the Moves-app. I use mnemonic cues with which I remember to implement my PA intention. I have compared my actualized PA with the PA goal I have set. I have thought about which reasons to do PA are important to me personally. I have made changes in my home (e.g. my room or my computer), so that starting PA would be easier. I have asked my friends or family for support to reach my PA goals. If I haven’t reached my PA goal, I have evaluated, what went wrong.</p>

<p>The answer scale was as follows:</p>
<p>0 = not at all true 1 … 4 [unlabeled] 5 = completely true</p>
<p>Items are as follows:</p>
<p>I have set PA goals for myself. I have personally made a specific plan (“what, where, how”) to implement my PA. I have a PA plan, which has been made by someone else, e.g. my sports club (e.g. a workout schedule). I have a way by which I remind myself of my PA plan, e.g. I write it down in the calendar. I have cut larger PA goals to smaller subgoals. I have tried out new ways for me to be physically active. I have pondered, what kind of difficult situations or barriers prevent me from implementing my PA plan. I have planned for ways to overcome barriers to doing PA. I have thought about how PA fits my identity (self concept). I have attempted to find ways to exercise so, that it won’t obstruct but instead helps actualise my other life values.</p>
