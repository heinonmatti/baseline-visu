Data setup code used in all the sections can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heinonmatti/baseline-visu/master/baseline-datasetup.R).

A concise codebook for the variables can be accessed [here](codebook_concise.html) and a more elaborate one with scale properties [here](codebook_elaborate.html).
